    <h1 class="title">About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is Reyaan. I am a student interested in coding. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, particularly ones with strategic elements. I'm fascinated by economics and how systems of trade, resource allocation, and market dynamics shape our world. I'm currently learning new programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Rust.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm also passionate about game design and 3D modeling. I've been exploring tools like Blender to create 3D assets and learn the fundamentals of game development. The creative process of designing game mechanics, crafting environments, and bringing characters to life through modeling fascinates me. It combines technical skills with artistic vision, making it a perfect intersection of my interests in programming and creative expression.</p>
    <br>
    <p> Aside from coding and gaming, I have a fondness for sports, especially those that require agility and quick reflexes. Fencing and archery are two of my favorite sports, as they demand both physical skill and mental focus. I find these activities both challenging and rewarding, but I really enjoy the discipline and concentration they require.</p>
