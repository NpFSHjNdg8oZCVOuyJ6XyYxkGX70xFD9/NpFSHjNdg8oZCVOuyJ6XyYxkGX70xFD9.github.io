    <h1 class="title">Post Project Overview</h1>
    <p>In this post-project overview, I will discuss the design choices I made while creating this website and the
        learning experience I gained throughout the process.</p>

    <div class="overview-content">
        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Design Choices</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>Throughout this project, I shuffled through multiple design choices. I experimented with different
                    color schemes, layouts, and typography to find the best combination that balanced aesthetics and
                    usability.
                    Originally, my website had a black and red theme, but that seemed too harsh in my eyes. As a result,
                    I switched to a softer black and white design. This was much easier on the eyes and provided a
                    cleaner, professional look.
                    As time went on, I strived to incorporate more unique design choices, which I did by adding a live
                    video wallpaper background. But this had a major flaw - it made text borderline unreadable.
                    To solve this, I implemented frosted glass effects using the CSS backdrop property, which blurred
                    the background behind text sections, significantly improving readability while maintaining the
                    dynamic and sleek feel of the video wallpaper. Despite this, I felt my website was too plain, choppy, and rough. To
                    address this, I used CSS to create simple animations and transitions, adding smooth fades and
                    movements to elements as users navigated the site.
                    These animations created a more engaging and polished user experience. However, I realized that not everyone
                    appreciates heavy animations, some users prefer simpler, cleaner interfaces, while others might experience
                    performance issues on lower-end devices. This led me to develop a comprehensive three-theme system that gives
                    users full control over their experience. The <strong>Animated theme</strong> features the live video wallpaper
                    with frosted glass effects and CSS animations. The <strong>Static theme</strong> removes all animations and the
                    video background, offering a lightweight, distraction-free experience perfect for accessibility and performance.
                    The <strong>Flow theme</strong> showcases a custom-built canvas animation with 5,000 rotating lines that create
                    a mesmerizing spiral effect, demonstrating advanced JavaScript and HTML5 canvas techniques.
                    To make theme switching seamless, I implemented a settings dropdown menu accessible from any page, which uses
                    localStorage to persist user preferences across sessions. I also added a sound effects toggle and background music
                    feature, giving users even more customization options. This evolution from a single static design to a fully
                    customizable, multi-theme experience represents the culmination of my vision for user-centric design.

            <summary>Technical Implementation</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with advanced features that demonstrate modern web development
                    techniques. Originally, I barely even had a website, it was a singular, horribly styled webpage with elements all over the place.
                    As time went on, I learned how to use JavaScript to link multiple pages together, creating a
                    multi-page website structure. This allowed me to organize content better and provide a more seamless
                    navigation experience for users.
                    I also delved deeper into CSS, styling every microdetail to achieve perfection. While my website
                    looked engaging, I wanted to make it <em>feel</em> engaging as well. To do this, I implemented a
                    series of small games and widgets onto my website.
                    My most notable widget is the clicker game, which features an upgrade system, automatic clicking mechanics,
                    critical click multipliers, and game state persistence. This game not only provided an interactive element for
                    users but also allowed me to develop, practice, refine, and showcase my JavaScript skills. There
                    are also other widgets, such as a counter and timer game.
                    The counter widget allows users to calculate the exact time until class ends by inputting the desired
                    period and day. The timer game challenges users to click a moving button that increasingly speeds up
                    and shrinks as difficulty increases.
                    Beyond the games, I implemented a sophisticated theme system that dynamically swaps CSS stylesheets based on user
                    selection. The three themes (Animated, Static, and Flow) each load different CSS files, controlled by enabling and
                    disabling stylesheet links via JavaScript. User preferences are stored in localStorage, ensuring their chosen theme
                    persists across page navigation and browser sessions. The Flow theme features a custom HTML5 canvas animation that
                    renders 5,000 individual lines rotating around a central point with varying speeds and opacities, creating a dynamic
                    spiral effect. This required understanding canvas rendering, animation loops using requestAnimationFrame, mathematical
                    transformations with trigonometry, and performance optimization to handle thousands of elements smoothly.
                    I also integrated audio functionality with background music and sound effects that users can toggle through the settings
                    menu. The settings dropdown itself uses event propagation handling to close when clicking outside, and all settings sync
                    across pages through localStorage.

        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Learning Experience</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">This project has taught me invaluable lessons about modern web design, CSS animations, user experience,
                    and most importantly, self-directed learning and problem-solving.
                    I learned how to balance aesthetics with functionality, implement JavaScript to create a whole tree
                    of webpages, and create a cohesive design system that works across multiple pages. As I developed my website, I
                    felt an increasingly strong drive to further advance. But we only covered the basics in class, this severely limited the
                    functionality of my website and prevented me from fulfilling my vision. I decided to take control and research advanced JavaScript and CSS
                    concepts independently. While this would bring my website to its maximum potential, it also served as a massive bottleneck.
                    Trying to understand advanced syntax and concepts like HTML5 canvas rendering, localStorage APIs, event delegation,
                    CSS backdrop filters, and mathematical transformations for animations was extremely time-draining as well as mentally challenging.
                    However, I managed to push past these obstacles and bring my site to its utmost potential.
                    Learning to implement the Flow canvas animation was particularly enlightening. I had to grasp concepts like
                    requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps animations, polar coordinates for circular motion, trigonometric functions
                    (sine and cosine) for calculating positions, and optimization techniques to render thousands of elements without lag.
                    I also learned about the browser's localStorage API for data persistence, dynamic stylesheet management, and event propagation
                    to create the settings dropdown functionality. Understanding how to structure code for maintainability became crucial as
                    my project grew, I organized separate CSS files for each theme and JavaScript files for each page's functionality.
                    While I had the option of using AI to boost functionality, I figured that it would not truly help with my skills.
                    I did use GitHub Copilot, but I limited it to creating code that I could understand, and if that wasn't an option, I had it
                    explain everything in detail. This approach allowed me to develop my skills while also ensuring my ideas could be
                    brought to life. Every feature I implemented, I made sure I understood the underlying mechanics and could explain how it works.
                    This project transformed me from someone who could create basic static webpages into a developer capable of building
                    complex, interactive, multi-themed web applications with persistent user preferences and advanced visual effects.</p>

            <summary>Failures and Challenges</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">Many errors, failures, and challenges arose throughout the development process. While some were
                    minor, such as forgetting to link a JavaScript file to an HTML file, the majority stemmed from deeper
                    misunderstandings of JavaScript and CSS concepts. GitHub Copilot played a significant role in debugging these errors, often
                    highlighting mistakes I had overlooked. However, there were instances where Copilot's suggestions were incorrect, leading to
                    further confusion and errors. In these cases, I had to rely on my own understanding and research to identify and fix the issues.
                    One of the most significant challenges I faced was implementing the live video wallpaper background.
                    It initially disrupted the layout and sometimes loaded after other content, causing glitches.
                    Through research, I discovered the preload attribute, which ensured the video loaded
                    smoothly and consistently, maintaining both functionality and a polished, dynamic appearance.
                    Working with the live video background provided valuable learning opportunities. It required careful
                    use of CSS z-index and positioning, reinforcing problem-solving, debugging, research skills, and the ability
                    to balance aesthetics with usability.
                    Implementing the three-theme system presented unique challenges. Initially, theme switching caused flickering and style conflicts
                    because stylesheets weren't being properly disabled. I had to learn about the disabled property on link elements and ensure
                    the theme application logic correctly toggled all relevant stylesheets. Getting the Flow canvas animation to work across all
                    pages was particularly tricky, I had to handle canvas initialization, window resizing, and ensure the animation didn't run when
                    the canvas was hidden to avoid wasting resources. Performance optimization became critical when rendering 5,000 animated lines;
                    I had to use requestAnimationFrame instead of setInterval, optimize my rendering loop, and carefully manage canvas clearing
                    with semi-transparent fills to create the trailing effect without performance degradation.
                    localStorage also introduced unexpected challenges. I initially struggled with synchronizing theme changes across pages and
                    ensuring settings persisted correctly. I learned that localStorage only stores strings, so any complex data structures would
                    need JSON serialization. The settings dropdown required careful event handling to prevent it from closing when clicking inside
                    it while still closing when clicking outside. This taught me about event propagation and stopPropagation().
                    Audio implementation had its own hurdles. Browsers have autoplay policies that prevent audio from playing without user interaction,
                    so I had to design the music system to respect these constraints. Managing audio state across pages required careful localStorage
                    coordination. Throughout all these challenges, I learned that debugging complex systems requires patience, systematic testing,
                    and often stepping away from the problem to approach it with fresh perspective. Each obstacle overcome made me a stronger developer.</p>
