    <h1 class="title">Post Project Overview</h1>
    <p>In this post-project overview, I will discuss the design choices I made while creating this website and the
        learning experience I gained throughout the process.</p>

    <div class="overview-content">
        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Design Choices</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>Throughout this project, I shuffled through multiple design choices. I experimented with different
                    color schemes, layouts, and typography to find the best combination that balanced aesthetics and
                    usability.
                    Originally, my website had a black and red theme, but that seemed too harsh in my eyes. As a result,
                    I switched to a softer black and white design. This was much easier on the eyes and provided a
                    cleaner, professional look.
                    As time went on, I strived to incorporate more unique design choices, which I did by adding a live
                    video wallpaper background. But this had a major flaw - it made text borderline unreadable.
                    To solve this, I implemented frosted glass effects using the CSS backdrop property, which blurred
                    the background behind text sections, significantly improving readability while maintaining the
                    dynamic and sleek
                    feel of the video wallpaper. Despite this, I felt my website was too plain, choppy, and rough. To
                    address this, I used CSS to make simple animations and transitions, adding smooth fades and
                    movements to elements as users navigated the site.
                    These animations created a more engaging and polished user experience, which in turn, gave me a
                    sense of completion and satisfaction with my work.

        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Technical Implementation</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>This website uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Originally, I barely even had a website - it was a
                    singular, horribly styled webpage with elements all over the place.
                    As time went on, I learned how to use Javascript to link multiple pages together, creating a
                    multi-page website structure. This allowed me to organize content better and provide a more seamless
                    navigation experience for users.
                    I also delved deeper into CSS, styling every microdetail to achieve perfection. While my website
                    looked engaging, I wanted to make it it <em>feel</em> engaging aswell.To do this, I implemented a
                    series of small games and widgets onto my website.
                    My most notable widget is the clicker game. This game not only provided an interactive element for
                    users but also allowed me to develope, practice, refine, and showcase my Javascript skills. There
                    are also other widgets, such as a counter and timer game.
                    The counter widget allows user to calculate the exact time until class ends by inputting the desired
                    period and day. The timer game challenges users to click a moving button that increasingly speeds up
                    and shrinks as difficulty increases.

        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Learning Experience</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>This project has taught me valuable lessons about modern web design, CSS animations, and user
                    experience.
                    I learned how to balance aesthetics with functionality, implement Javascript to create a whole tree
                    of webpages
                    and create a cohesive design system that works across multiple pages. As I developed my website, I
                    felt an increasingly strong
                    strive to further advance. But yet we only covered the basics in class - this severely limited the
                    functionality of my website, and prevented
                    me from fufilling my goal. I decided to take control and research advanced Javascript and CSS
                    elements. While this would bring my website to its maxiumum
                    potential, it also served as a massive bottleneck. Trying to understand advanced syntax was
                    extremely time draining aswell as mentally challenging, but I
                    managed to push past and bring my site to its utmost potential. While the option of using AI to
                    boost functionality, I figured that it would not
                    truely help with my skills. While I did use Github CoPilot, I limited it to creating code that I
                    could understand, and if that wasn't an option, I had it
                    explain everything, which allowed me to develop my skills while also ensuring my ideas could be
                    brought to life.</p>

        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Failures and Challenges</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>Many errors, failures, and challenges arose throughout the development process. While some were
                    minor, such as
                    forgetting to link a JavaScript file to an HTML file, the majority stemmed from deeper
                    misunderstandings of JavaScript
                    and CSS concepts. GitHub Copilot played a significant role in debugging these errors, often
                    highlighting mistakes I had
                    overlooked. However, there were instances where Copilot's suggestions were incorrect, leading to
                    further confusion and errors.
                    In these cases, I had to rely on my own understanding and research to identify and fix the issues.
                    One of the most significant challenges I faced was implementing the live video wallpaper background.
                    It initially disrupted the layout and sometimes loaded after other content, causing glitches.
                    Through research, I discovered the preload attribute, which ensured the video loaded
                    smoothly and consistently, maintaining both functionality and a polished, dynamic appearance.
                    Working with the live video background provided valuable learning opportunities. It required careful
                    use of CSS,
                    z-index, and positioning, reinforcing problem-solving, debugging, research skills, and the ability
                    to balance aesthetics
                    with usability.
