    <h1 class="title">Post Project Overview</h1>
    <p>In this post-project overview, I will discuss the design choices I made while creating this website and the
        learning experience I gained throughout the process.</p>

    <div class="overview-content">
        <details class="dropdown">
            <summary>Design Choices</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>Throughout this project, I experimented with different color schemes, layouts, and typography to balance aesthetics and usability.
                    Originally, my website had a black and red theme, but that seemed too harsh. I switched to a softer black and white design
                    that was easier on the eyes and more professional.
                    I then added a live video wallpaper background, but it made text borderline unreadable.
                    To solve this, I implemented frosted glass effects using CSS backdrop property, which blurred
                    the background behind text sections while maintaining the dynamic feel. I also added CSS animations and transitions for smooth fades and movements.
                    Realizing not everyone appreciates heavy animations, I developed a two-theme system.
                    The <strong>Animated theme</strong> features the live video wallpaper with frosted glass effects and CSS animations.
                    The <strong>Static theme</strong> removes all animations, offering a lightweight, distraction-free experience.
                    I implemented a settings dropdown menu using localStorage to persist user preferences across sessions, plus sound effects toggle and background music.
                    This evolution from a single static design to a fully customizable experience represents my vision for user-centric design.

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with advanced features demonstrating modern web development.
                    Originally just a horribly styled single webpage, I learned to use JavaScript to link multiple pages together,
                    creating a multi-page structure with seamless navigation.
                    I delved deeper into CSS, styling every microdetail. To make the site feel engaging, I implemented
                    games and widgets. My clicker game features an upgrade system, automatic clicking mechanics,
                    critical click multipliers, and game state persistence. The counter widget calculates exact time until class ends.
                    The timer game challenges users to click a moving button that speeds up and shrinks.
                    I implemented a sophisticated theme system that dynamically swaps CSS stylesheets based on user
                    selection. User preferences are stored in localStorage, persisting across page navigation and sessions.
                    I integrated audio functionality with background music and sound effects togglable through the settings
                    menu. The settings dropdown uses event propagation handling, and all settings sync across pages through localStorage.

            <summary>Learning Experience</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">This project taught me invaluable lessons about modern web design, CSS animations, user experience,
                    and self-directed learning.
                    I learned to balance aesthetics with functionality and create a cohesive design system across multiple pages.
                    Class only covered the basics, severely limiting my website's functionality. I decided to research advanced JavaScript and CSS
                    concepts independently. Understanding HTML5 canvas rendering, localStorage APIs, event delegation,
                    CSS backdrop filters, and mathematical transformations was time-draining and mentally challenging, but I pushed through.
                    I learned localStorage for data persistence, dynamic stylesheet management, and event propagation.
                    Code structure for maintainability became crucial as my project grew.
                    While I used GitHub Copilot, I limited it to code I could understand, having it
                    explain everything in detail. This approach developed my skills while bringing my ideas to life.
                    This project transformed me from creating basic webpages to building
                    complex, interactive, multi-themed applications with persistent preferences and advanced visual effects.</p>

            <summary>Failures and Challenges</summary>
            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p class="content">Many errors and challenges arose during development. While some were
                    minor, like forgetting to link JavaScript files, the majority stemmed from deeper
                    misunderstandings of JavaScript and CSS concepts. GitHub Copilot helped debug errors, but sometimes gave incorrect suggestions.
                    In those cases, I relied on my own understanding and research.
                    A significant challenge was implementing the live video wallpaper background.
                    It initially disrupted the layout and loaded after other content, causing glitches.
                    Through research, I discovered the preload attribute, ensuring smooth loading.
                    Implementing the two-theme system presented unique challenges. Theme switching caused flickering and style conflicts
                    because stylesheets weren't properly disabled. I learned about the disabled property on link elements.
                    localStorage introduced unexpected challenges. I struggled with synchronizing theme changes across pages. The settings dropdown required careful event handling
                    using stopPropagation(). Audio implementation had its own hurdles with browser autoplay policies.
                    Throughout these challenges, I learned that debugging requires patience, systematic testing, and fresh perspective.</p>
